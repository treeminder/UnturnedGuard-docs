Does UnturnedGuard auto update? How does it work?
=============================================================

UnturnedGuard utilizes an automatic update process using Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). Rather than relying on manual updates, it's automatic using the CI/CD Process

.. admonition:: **UnturnedGuard Auto-Update Process**

   **Auto-Update Process:**

   When a new version becomes available, this is announced through our Discord channel, in the ``publishes`` channel. Here's how the update process works:

   1. **Automated CI/CD**: UnturnedGuard's CI/CD system takes charge of the update process. It ensures the latest version is fetched and prepared for installation.

   2. **User Notification**: Users are informed about the new version via the Discord announcement. This notification will let you know that an update is ready for installation.

   3. **Simple Update**: To apply the update, the process is straightforward. You can simply restart your server. Restarting your server for a simple update is optional. Although for critical updates or hotfixes, immediate server restart is highly recommended.

   This automated update approach ensures that users can effortlessly maintain their UnturnedGuard installation at the latest version. Whether you choose to restart your server immediately for important updates or at your convenience, you can enjoy the benefits of the latest features and fixes with minimal effort.
